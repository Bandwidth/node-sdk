# Callback

Callbacks are divided into two types based on direction of the related message: - `statusCallback` indicates status of an outbound MT SMS, MMS, or RBM message. - `inboundCallback` indicates an inbound MO message or a multichannel message client\'s response to a suggestion or location request.
