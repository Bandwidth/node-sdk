# BridgeCompleteCallback

If the target call leaves the <Bridge>, then this callback is sent to the bridgeCompleteUrl, and the BXML returned in it is executed on the call. If this webhook is sent, the Bridge Target Complete webhook is NOT sent. This callback is also sent if any problem occurs that prevents the calls to be bridged.
